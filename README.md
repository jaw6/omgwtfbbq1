# OMG WTF BBQ

This app has monkeys. And you can name them.

```sh
$ bundle
$ rake db:create db:migrate db:setup
$ rails s
```

Then visit `localhost:3000` and click "Update!" and just watch the monkeys' names get longer and longer.

### Seriously?

Demonstrating using jQuery, Rails, 'PUT' methods, and updating records remotely with ajax.

And a *little* CoffeeScript.
